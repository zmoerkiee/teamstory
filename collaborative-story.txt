Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away.  Things happened! It was snowy and sunny at the same time. 

Then, one day, something very, very big happened. 

He opened his door and outside his door was a huge hulking beast! Neadless to say, 
the beast was stunned!

The person that opened the door was a cute little penguin wearing a brown coat and a grey hat that looked
up at the beast.
